# Mother of All Tools 370

MOAT370 is an evolution of MOAT369, based purely in shell script and can run against multiple database vendors (not only Oracle as its predecessor).

The goal of this framework is to allow anyone to easily extract information from the Database or the Operating System into a fancy HTML format with tables and charts, with minimal coding required.
